# REQUESTMAX - Maximum number of requests that will be processed in a single run.
# I primarily use this for testing so I don't blow through my test data so quickly.
# For testing I set it to 1 or 2.
#
# In production, it could prevent a runaway train from taking over the system.
# Maybe set it to 100 or 1000 for production. One consideration for production relates
# to how many emails your SMTP relay will permit you to send. For example, if the
# SMTP relay host only allows 600 per hour and you run this script every 30 seconds,
# then set REQUESTMAX=5, that way you can't exceed the maximum email relay count for 
# that hour.
#
# If set to 0, there is no limit to the number of requests that will be
# processed.
REQUESTMAX=1
